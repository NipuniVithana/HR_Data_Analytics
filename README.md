# HR Data Analytics Power BI Project

## Project Overview

This project involves analyzing the attendance data of employees in a software and data solutions company over three months. The dataset includes various types of attendance records such as present, paid leave, sick leave, work from home, and others. The goal is to understand the working preferences of employees and the overall percentage of sick leaves. This analysis is performed using Power BI, where we utilize Power Query for data transformation and DAX for creating metrics. The final outcome is a comprehensive dashboard that provides insights into the attendance patterns and preferences of employees.
